<h2>Pangur Bán</h2>
<h4>By Anonymous</h4>
<p>
    Pangur Bán and I at work,<br>
    Adepts, equals, cat and clerk:<br>
    His whole instinct is to hunt,<br>
    Mine to free the meaning pent.<br>

    More than loud acclaim, I love<br>
    Books, silence, thought, my alcove.<br>
    Happy for me, Pangur Bán<br>
    Child-plays round some mouse’s den.<br>

    Truth to tell, just being here,<br>
    Housed alone, housed together,<br>
    Adds up to its own reward:<br>
    Concentration, stealthy art.<br>

    Next thing an unwary mouse<br>
    Bares his flank: Pangur pounces.<br>
    Next thing lines that held and held<br>
    Meaning back begin to yield.<br>

    All the while, his round bright eye<br>
    Fixes on the wall, while I<br>
    Focus my less piercing gaze<br>
    On the challenge of the page.<br>

    With his unsheathed, perfect nails<br>
    Pangur springs, exults and kills.<br>
    When the longed-for, difficult<br>
    Answers come, I too exult.<br>

    So it goes. To each his own.<br>
    No vying. No vexation.<br>
    Taking pleasure, taking pains,<br>
    Kindred spirits, veterans.<br>

    Day and night, soft purr, soft pad,<br>
    Pangur Bán has learned his trade.<br>
    Day and night, my own hard work<br>
    Solves the cruxes, makes a mark.<br>
